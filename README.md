A helper utility to make it easier to get a JSON Web Token (JWT) printed to your terminal (or copied to your clipboard with the `--copy` flag). Currently only Azure AD is supported.

If this is the first time that get-jwt is being run against an App Registration in Azure AD, there's a couple one-time steps to do (see [Azure prerequisites](#azure-prerequisites)).

## Installing

### Homebrew

If you have Homebrew installed for MacOS or Linux, you can install from the tap with:

```
brew tap egineering-llc/get-jwt https://github.com/egineering-llc/get-jwt
brew install get-jwt
```

### Binary

Pre-built binaries are available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux in the [Github Releases](https://github.com/egineering-llc/get-jwt/releases).

An example of installing the binary for Linux would be:

```
curl -LO https://github.com/egineering-llc/get-jwt/releases/download/v0.1.2/get-jwt_0.1.2_linux_amd64
mv get-jwt_0.1.2_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/get-jwt
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/get-jwt
```

### Go

If you have Go installed locally, you can install get-jwt with:

```
go install github.com/egineering-llc/get-jwt
```

### Set up command completion

To be able to tab-complete commands, enter a line like this into your `~/.bashrc` file if you're using bash:

```
source <(get-jwt completion bash)
```

And then source your shell's rc file with `source ~/.bashrc`, or just start a new terminal tab.

Command completion is available for the shells: `bash`, `zsh`, `powershell`, and `fish`.

## Running

Starting with the base command of `get-jwt azure`, you'll need to provide three flags:
  - `--client-id`: The Application (client) ID
  - `--tenant-id`: The Directory (tenant) ID
  - `--scope`: The scope you are requesting access to

```
get-jwt azure --client-id c3ba59ce-1840-4824-b0b5-539d951c3b9c --tenant-id 76dd4f83-97f4-429d-8f93-b230bcf24989 --scope api://c3ba59ce-1840-4824-b0b5-539d951c3b9c/Read
```

## Configuration

|     Flag      |     Environment variable     | Default value |
| :-----------: | :--------------------------: | :-----------: |
| `--client-id` | `GET_JWT_AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID` |    (none)     |
| `--tenant-id` | `GET_JWT_AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID` |    (none)     |
|   `--scope`   |   `GET_JWT_AZURE_AD_SCOPE`   |    (none)     |
|   `--copy`    | `GET_JWT_COPY_TO_CLIPBOARD`  |     false     |

## Azure prerequisites

There is some initial setup we need to do in App Registrations if this is the first time this tool is being run against it:

1. Add a **Mobile and desktop applications** platform, with `http://localhost` as a Redirect URI
    - Navigate to your App Registration in the Azure portal
    - Open the Authentication tab in the left sidebar
    - Click **Add a platform**
    - Choose **Mobile and desktop applications**
    - Under **Custom redirect URIs**, enter `http://localhost` to allow Azure to redirect back to the random port opened by get-jwt locally
2. Enable **Allow public client flows**
    - Remain on the same Authentication tab
    - Under **Advanced settings** at the bottom, toggle the slider for **Allow public client flows** to `Yes`

## Contributing

### Building

To build a binary locally in this folder at `./get-jwt`, run:

```
go build .
```

To test new changes without making a build artifact:

```
go run main.go <any subcommands or flags here>
```

### Releasing

The Github Actions to run goreleaser are triggered by a push of a tag. Example:

```
git tag v0.2.1
git push origin v0.2.1
```

### To-dos

- [ ] Add a `version` subcommand
- [ ] Handle some common errors from MSAL more gracefully
- [ ] Add a `--quiet` flag to only output the JWT, for easier use in scripts
- [ ] Look into Viper for handling the injesting of env vars and flags
- [ ] Mark some flags with `cmd.MarkFlagRequired`
- [ ] Set up MSAL's token caching
